## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a **Student Management Dashboard**, built to help small institutions, teachers, or administrators **easily manage student records**.  
It provides a user-friendly web interface for performing all essential CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and stores data locally in the browser using **localStorage**, ensuring data persists even after page reloads.

The dashboard uses a **tabular display** to present student data and allows users to add, edit, delete, and optionally search student entries based on name or department.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Smaller educational institutions and coaching centers often lack the resources or technical support to implement full-scale database systems.  
There is a need for a lightweight, browser-based tool that enables easy **student data management** without the need for a backend server.
